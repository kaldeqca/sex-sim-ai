# Sex Sim AI

Sex Sim AI is an immersive, web-based erotic roleplaying simulator powered by Google's Gemini API. It allows users to create a character by uploading an image and defining their personality, then engage in an interactive, AI-driven sexual roleplay. The application is designed to be highly customizable, featuring multi-language support, theme switching, and color personalization.

## ‚ú® Features

- **AI-Powered Roleplay**: Utilizes the Google Gemini API to generate dynamic, immersive, and erotic narratives.
- **Visual Character Creation**: Upload a character image via drag & drop or pasting from the clipboard.
- **Deep Customization**: Define the character's name, age, gender, personality, and an optional starting scenario.
- **Interactive Gameplay**: The AI provides a descriptive narrative and three distinct action choices to drive the story forward. Users can also type their own custom actions.
- **Multi-Language Support**: Fully internationalized UI and AI prompts for English (EN), Chinese (‰∏≠Êñá), and Japanese (Êó•Êú¨Ë™û).
- **Theming**: Instantly switch between a sleek Light Mode and an eye-friendly Dark Mode.
- **Personalized Colors**: Choose from a palette of 12 accent colors to customize the UI to your liking.
- **Randomizers**: Dice buttons to randomly select a personality or scenario from a pre-defined, extensive list.
- **Robust Error Handling**: If an API call fails, the app allows you to retry your last action without losing your place in the story.
- **Responsive Design**: A clean, modern interface that works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **State Persistence**: Your chosen theme, language, and accent color are saved in your browser's `localStorage`.

## üöÄ How It Works

The application is built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and modern JavaScript (ES6 Modules).

1.  **Setup**: The user enters their Gemini API Key and fills out the character's details (name, age, personality, etc.) and uploads an image.
2.  **Initialization**: When the "Begin" button is clicked, the `script.js` file gathers all the user input.
3.  **System Prompt**: A detailed system prompt from `config.js` is combined with the character data. This prompt instructs the Gemini model on how to behave, what tone to use, and how to structure its JSON response.
4.  **API Call**: The initial prompt and image are sent to the Google Gemini API.
5.  **UI Update**: The AI's JSON response is parsed. The main narrative text is displayed, and the three action choices are rendered as buttons.
6.  **Interaction Loop**: The user clicks an option or writes a custom action, which is then sent as the next message in the conversation history to the API, continuing the story.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup and Usage

To run this project locally, you will need a Google Gemini API Key.

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/sex-sim-ai.git
    cd sex-sim-ai
    ```

2.  **Run a Local Server**
    Because the project uses ES6 modules (`import`/`export`) and fetches `lang.json`, you must run it from a local web server. You cannot simply open `index.html` as a local file. A simple way to do this is with Python:

    ```bash
    # If you have Python 3
    python -m http.server

    # If you have Python 2
    python -m SimpleHTTPServer
    ```
    Or use the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension for VS Code.

3.  **Open in Browser**
    Navigate to `http://localhost:8000` (or the port your server is running on).

4.  **Configure the App**
    - Get your **Gemini API Key** from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
    - Paste the key into the "Gemini API Key" field in the app.
    - Fill in all the character details and upload an image.
    - Click "Begin" to start the simulation.
